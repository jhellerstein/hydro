## 0.13.2 (2025-04-17)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-b7b040817eb3b5f601989592465a3829f93ef7b7/> update pinned nightly to 2025-04-05, clippy fixes
   Not going past 2024-04-05 due to rustc linker regression on windows:
   https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/139821

### Style

 - <csr-id-fe91f37ec43b20c1652560aebb15ac8d1596c0a4/> use where clauses to increase readability
   A minor issue in the grand scheme of things, but I caught myself
   squinting when trying to tease apart different trait implementations
   specially when following the "implementations" popup navigation. In
   addition, some of the generic variable naming was not consistent and a
   bit confusing to the uninitiated. For example, `Order` was a generic
   variable, but `TotalOrder` and `NoOrder` were a type. Not a big deal
   when you already know the API, but just adds friction someone new to the
   project.
   
   Here are some of the items that guided the PR:
   * Single capital letter for generic variables following a loose
   standard: T for types, O for ordering, B for boundedness, L for
   location, P for process or external process, C for cluster, etc.
   * Use `where` clauses to keep the head of traits and functions lean and
   more easily comparable.

## 0.13.1 (2025-04-12)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e41388edeaeffec689d46503bfdea467a53be797/> Enable file_lock feature in nightly builds
   This appears to be a regression from the commit that uses fs2 on stable
   builds.
   
   @mingweisamuel based on the CI error here it's because the feature was previously stabilized and has since been un-stabilized

<csr-id-79ee5041c2b73bca38a02463a073c082bc33a91c/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6d24901550fa873fc8b4b474f9f6316d98cf7aa8/> implement profiling for macOS and Windows using samply
 - <csr-id-bfac9f1c29eee56eae9d4d2524b417235a0e5849/> only serialize once in broadcast
 - <csr-id-5ac247ca2006bbb45c5511c78dc6d9028f7451da/> update Stageleft and reduce reliance on DFIR re-exports
 - <csr-id-e0c4abb02054fc3d5dc866286b18f3f2bcd2ad36/> update Stageleft to reduce viral dependencies
   Now that Stageleft handles quoted snippets that refer to local
   dependencies, we do not need to duplicate deps into downstream crates.
 - <csr-id-127df13b7d7fc12d5265f1d7517f3b66a774dc07/> add resolve_futures and resolve_futures_ordered APIs

### Bug Fixes

<csr-id-53d2913bc66c67b45a2baa591740a5f06a087d57/>

 - <csr-id-2219e6b954649906d002e7d4cd3f228b3c9369fe/> correctly resolve `__staged` paths for the crate being launched
 - <csr-id-fbb5fab72c5a64a07653c9b6389186ad079703ec/> handle `-1` addresses from samply, fix `_counter()` rollover
   This fixes samply profiling on my "ancient" 2019 x86-64 macbook pro
   15.3.2 (24D81)
   
   This pull request aims to fix the handling of –1 address values from
   samply by updating tracing filenames and refactoring related error and
   type handling. Key changes include:
   - Better error messages when `dtrace` or `samply` are not instaled.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-79ee5041c2b73bca38a02463a073c082bc33a91c/> use `fs2` file locking to fix stable build testing #1780

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dfb7a1b5ad47f03822e9b7cae7dae81914b305e2/> don't pull in dfir_rs during the compilation stage
   Because `hydro_lang` is responsible for _generating_ DFIR code, it
   doesn't actually need to depend on the runtime (`dfir_rs`), other than
   when it is used in the (legacy) macro mode or when we want to include
   utilities for runtime logic (`resource_measurement`). This sticks those
   pieces under feature flags and makes `dfir_rs` an optional dependency,
   which reduces the compile tree for crates like `hydro_test`.

<csr-id-7dd71d67da162d2e4f3043b271a52037a3c983c0/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-38e6721be69f6a41aa47a01a9d06d56a01be1355/> remove stageleft from repo, fix #1764
   They grow up so fast 🥹
 - <csr-id-f14174e92875b3264ef811effd954ed76cb3c948/> update pinned nightly to 2025-03-10, clippy cleanups

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-b235a42a3071e55da7b09bdc8bc710b18e0fe053/> demote python deploy docs, fix docsrs configs, fix #1392, fix #1629
   Running thru the quickstart in order to write more about Rust
   `hydro_deploy`, ran into some confusion due to feature-gated items not
   showing up in docs.
   
   `rustdocflags = [ '--cfg=docsrs', '--cfg=stageleft_runtime' ]` uses the
   standard `[cfg(docrs)]` as well as enabled our
   `[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` so things `impl<H: Host + 'static>
   IntoProcessSpec<'_, HydroDeploy> for Arc<H>` show up.
   
   Also set `--all-features` for the docsrs build

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ed662013a29f0acaaf02fec8d90086ebfe868af8/> fix failing Clippy on stable due to unused variable
 - <csr-id-fdcf96a817825d1801b50055395e0284a0db2942/> use file locks to avoid clobbering Cargo configs
 - <csr-id-530604ccce4e1825ea5a35caa696dec5e846fefb/> fix codegen non-determinism that triggers rebuilds
   Also makes the generated `Cargo.toml` fixed regardless of the "extra
   Hydro features" or "test mode", by shifting them into special features
   defined on the trybuild repo. Overall, this results in the only dynamic
   piece being the generated `src/bin` files, which means that deploying
   the same code multiple times does not result in any recompilation.

### Style

 - <csr-id-056ac62611319b7bd10a751d7e231423a1b8dc4e/> cleanup old clippy lints, remove deprecated `relalg` crate

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7dd71d67da162d2e4f3043b271a52037a3c983c0/> remove "hydroflow" for `hydro_deploy_integration`, `hydro_deploy::rust_crate`, fix #1712
   Opted to use `RustCrate` as the replacement prefix with the expectation
   that @shadaj may have a more coincise name in mind?

### New Features

 - <csr-id-ce134fa0bae4085a9f81f9e556a553618e3652ab/> add APIs for getting DFIR without deploying
   Also modifies DFIR to elide Stageleft `type_hint`s when pretty printing
   an operator (e.g. for Mermaid). Also, because we stratify the graph
   before we can print it, adds basic support for printing stratified
   graphs as a surface string.
 - <csr-id-65138b4a61f2f7263c68d26692204e89f5cbad3c/> Insert counter to measure cardinality for specific operators
 - <csr-id-4d9c0f92964c4f49ebc5ca0b72e404a61b434383/> Partitioning
 - <csr-id-1ab64e76d560a59e29094ce4da0391713b1cc35e/> Decoupling
   Mechanism for decoupling at specified nodes
   
   ---------
 - <csr-id-733494ea2655cdc1460da7f902d999f0e3797411/> Link DFIR operators to Hydro operators in perf
 - <csr-id-a4adb08700fdc5fdbc949fc656e6cb309e7159a5/> provide in-memory access to perf tracing results

 - <csr-id-e043cedf1999670bd5a5a93960748c89ca092f2b/> make `Stream::cloned` work with borrowed elements
 - <csr-id-316d700cf820fa448898ce8df95b5c6011c33cc0/> provide APIs for blanket-deploying locations
   This makes it easy to implement patterns like deploying everything to
   localhost.
 - <csr-id-6d77db9e52ece0b668587187c59f2862670db7cf/> send_partitioned operator and move decoupling
   Allows specifying a distribution policy (for deciding which partition to
   send each message to) before networking. Designed to be as easy as
   possible to inject (so the distribution policy function definition takes
   in the cluster ID, for example, even though it doesn't need to, because
   this way we can avoid project->map->join)
 - <csr-id-b968f5beccac2019b951cc5ab15891b48da01639/> allow developers to add their own re-export rewrites

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-0045599af763478c56b3599e7704fe24f26775e6/> update trybuild error message after Rust update
 - <csr-id-1f74d2f25a48963f372764d4cda2522f5a43faf9/> send_bincode_lifetime test
   Test expected stderr stemmed from importing the wrong library, not from
   the actual error regarding lifetimes
 - <csr-id-75eb323a612fd5d2609e464fe7690bc2b6a8457a/> use correct `__staged` path when rewriting `crate::` imports
   Previously, a rewrite would first turn `crate` into `crate::__staged`,
   and another would rewrite `crate::__staged` into `hydro_test::__staged`.
   The latter global rewrite is unnecessary because the stageleft logic
   already will use the full crate name when handling public types, so we
   drop it.
 - <csr-id-9fdb7709a94b09857d986272435e795f856435b3/> avoid crashes and miscompilations with unused locations
   Previously, if a location was not used in the graph, we would crash or
   use faulty IDs in the generated code. This also changes semantics
   slightly so that if there is a cluster with no assigned computation, it
   will be treated as an empty cluster at runtime (the list of cluster IDs
   will be an empty slice).

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5c1c16cef25e058281e26c04160998072953ae95/> raise a panic if a user forgets to complete a cycle
 - <csr-id-c49a4913cfdae021404a86e5a4d0597aa4db9fbe/> reduce where `#[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` needs to be used
   Simplifies the logic for generating the public clone of the code, which
   eliminates the need to sprinkle `#[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` (renamed
   from `#[stageleft::runtime]`) everywhere. Also adds logic to pass
   through `cfg` attrs when re-exporting public types.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-22de01f5f566cd8cf7cb3bd31ae8bed99bf1e9ab/> add `round_robin` helpers for networking
   Also fixes compiler crashes when using `.enumerate()` on an un-batched
   stream.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-032cde6492390733e3e82d7126cc84989bf31853/> drop nightly feature flag from trybuild codegen
 - <csr-id-f6989baf12631cf43a814123e274466740c2f159/> restrict lifetime parameters to be actually invariant
   Our lifetimes were accidentally made covariant when the lifetime `'a`
   was removed from the process/cluster tag type. This fixes that typing
   hole, and also loosens some restrictions on the lifetime of deploy
   environments.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-9ea5f061ee0f116caf8fc4ea99b62a9c7691be2a/> use `match_box` macro to compile on stable
 - <csr-id-ec55910f5a41d4f08059b5feda4b96fbd058c959/> generalize quorum logic

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c65b4c49f3a3f2dcc7c8c28d1871b88c6c954822/> minimize dependencies pulled into `trybuild` builds
   We don't need `hydroflow_lang` in the runtime builds, do some feature
   flagging to avoid it.
 - <csr-id-939389953875bf5f94ea84503a7a35efd7342282/> mark non-deterministic operators as unsafe and introduce timestamped streams
   Big PR.
   
   First big change is we introduce a `Timestamped` location. This is a bit
   of a hybrid between top-level locations and `Tick` locations. The idea
   is that you choose where timestamps are generated, and then have a
   guarantee that everything after that will be atomically computed (useful
   for making sure we add payloads to the log before ack-ing).
   
   The contract is that an operator or module that takes a `Timestamped`
   input must still be deterministic regardless of the stamps on messages
   (which are hidden unless you `tick_batch`). But unlike a top-level
   stream (which has the same constraints), you have the atomicity
   guarantee. Right now the guarantee is trivial since we have one global
   tick for everything. But in the future when we want to apply
   @davidchuyaya's optimizations this will be helpful to know when there
   are causal dependencies on when data can be sent to others.
   
   Second change is we mark every non-deterministic operator (modulo
   explicit annotations such as `NoOrder`) with Rust's `unsafe` keyword.
   This makes it super clear where non-determinism is taking place.
   
   I've used this to put `unsafe` blocks throughout our example code and
   add `SAFETY` annotations that argue why the non-determinism is safe (or
   point out that we've explicitly documented / expect non-determinism). I
   also added `#![warn(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` to the examples and the
   template, since this forces good hygiene of annotating sources of
   non-determinism even inside a module that is intentionally
   non-deterministic.
   
   Paxos changes are mostly refactors, and I verified that the performance
   is the same as before.
 - <csr-id-f96676d2d53d824c5c168e3db69722c2e9956fe2/> allow runtime context to be referenced as a global constant
 - <csr-id-a93a5e59e1681d325b3433193bb86254d23bdc77/> allow cluster self ID to be referenced as a global constant
   This eliminates the need to store `cluster.self_id()` in a local
   variable first, instead you can directly reference `CLUSTER_SELF_ID`.
 - <csr-id-4c5ca31486a9cfcbcba3af03aa30084a8b8dfcce/> introduce an unordered variant of streams to strengthen determinism guarantees
   Previously, sending data from a `Cluster` would return a stream assumed
   to have deterministic contents **and** ordering, which is false. This
   introduces another type parameter for `Stream` which tracks whether
   element ordering is expected to be deterministic, and restricts
   operators such as `fold` and `reduce` to commutative aggregations
   accordingly.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-eb1ad3a54705efb06ee3f0647deaa9a52731ae6e/> rename `union` to `chain` and restrict LHS to be bounded
   Returning a `Stream` from `union` on unbounded streams was unsound,
   since the order of outputs is not deterministic.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-251b1039c71d45d3f86123dba1926026ded80824/> use `cfg(nightly)` instead of feature, remove `-Z` flag, use `Diagnostic::try_emit`
   Previous PR (#1587) website build did not work because `panic = "abort"`
   is set on wasm, leading to aborts for `proc_macro2::Span::unwrap()`
   calls.
   
   All tests except trybuild seem to pass on stable, WIP #1587 next
 - <csr-id-78f6a3299fff822abaea50841800a07f0e2ae128/> further reduce namespace pollution
 - <csr-id-9f3c8c468c58b7ec50d1c104fc24db0920d13c0d/> don't re-export all of `hydroflow`
   Reduces namespace pollution when wildcard-importing `hydroflow_plus`.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-baedf23eaa056bc0dad8331d116bb71176764206/> improve quickstart ergonomics
 - <csr-id-98a21e36bd50d312402e46357fea6330816d0139/> add utility to dedup tees when debugging IR
 - <csr-id-2141c5f04cb7e9cb7cd2f50f849f6c4b3d745377/> add decouple and simple test and two_pc
 - <csr-id-074f2cf76158a126370a7e6b184bc6b928eb6fe2/> implement support for external network outputs
 - <csr-id-afe78c343658472513b34d28658634b253148aee/> add ability to have staged flows inside unit tests
   Whenever a Hydroflow+ program is compiled, it depends on a generated
   `__staged` module, which contains the entire contents of the crate but
   with every type / function made `pub` and exported, so that the compiled
   UDFs can resolve local references appropriately.
   
   Previously, we would not do this for `#[cfg(test)]` modules, since they
   may use `dev-dependencies` and therefore the generated module may fail
   to compile when not in test mode. To solve this, when running a unit
   test (marked with `hydroflow_plus::deploy::init_test()`) that uses
   trybuild, we emit a version of the `__staged` module with `#[cfg(test)]`
   modules included _into the generated trybuild sources_ because we can
   guarantee via trybuild that the appropriate `dev-dependencies` are
   available.
   
   This by itself allows crates depending on `hydroflow_plus` to have local
   unit tests with Hydroflow+ logic inside them. But we also want to use
   this support for unit tests inside `hydroflow_plus` itself. To enable
   that, we eliminate the `hydroflow_plus_deploy` crate and move its
   contents directly to `hydroflow_plus` itself so that we can access the
   trybuild machinery without incurring a circular dependency.
   
   Also fixes #1408
 - <csr-id-8a809315cd37929687fcabc34a12042db25d5767/> add API for external network inputs
   This is a key step towards being able to unit-test HF+ graphs, by being
   able to have controlled inputs. Outputs next.
 - <csr-id-60d9becaf0b67f9819316ce6d76bd867f7d46505/> splice UDFs with type hints to avoid inference failures

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-2faffdbf2cc886da22e496df64f46aefa380766c/> properly handle `crate::` imports
 - <csr-id-275a0edf1fb8eba467728c24edf3a984c8eaca75/> be more careful about which parts of proposer and acceptor have to be maintained atomically
 - <csr-id-87a68346aa10051d9d205d791407ce85546802da/> adjust default features to allow compilation to musl targets
   Previously, the default `deploy` feature would pull in Hydro Deploy and
   its transitive native dependencies.
   
   Also sets up `examples/paxos.rs` with CLI flags to deploy to GCP.
 - <csr-id-d4320e311562a004c01342a2b0f03ab6e2520562/> add missing `sample_every` for singletons
   Discovered during a live-coding demo, we only had it for optionals
   before.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-a1b45203178165683cb4b5ae611c598cc9c14853/> move rewrites to a submodule
 - <csr-id-e9d05bf11a0e85da8ed1a0fe00be7769298308c2/> move `HfCompiled` and friends to a module
 - <csr-id-9f744052dd4ac744f5a1baa4e0cb9253adaeba1b/> use `location.flow_state()` to avoid clone
 - <csr-id-5b819a2dc6c507222a3e22d71efcde8b43cebad5/> deduplicate some error messages and drop unused `Interval` IR node
 - <csr-id-244207c2acd2243ece6e787d54eadacf06e9e8bb/> dedup signatures for `Stream` operators
 - <csr-id-bf9dcd5a923dd4b5efa337a9127086e5609a1722/> clean up traits for cycles and forward references
 - <csr-id-d9634f242a97c06bdb53011bf3d75256425a1598/> split up location module and store locations directly in streams
 - <csr-id-534fe974101e38ecb847cd759dbaf503ff97f822/> use `usize` for slot numbers
 - <csr-id-0a5abab3dac224c9591bcdd837d07c6e5c2773c6/> make Paxos-KV generic
 - <csr-id-38b17cd977fb6c00ddc37e7a5b30e45dba17329e/> simplify latency calculations
 - <csr-id-8b7b1c60fd33b78f9a4b0873bbbd150260ae2ad5/> complete split into leader election and sequencing phases
 - <csr-id-dff2a40669736014349cf12744d6a057a7992e11/> start splitting out leader election into a separate module

### Style

 - <csr-id-47cb703e771f7d1c451ceb9d185ada96410949da/> fixes for nightly clippy
   a couple few spurious `too_many_arguments` and a spurious
   `zombie_processes` still on current nightly (`clippy 0.1.84 (4392847410
   2024-10-21)`)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8d8b4b2288746e0aa2a95329d91297820aee7586/> implicitly apply default optimizations
   This also changes the behavior of `with_default_optimize` to be
   terminal, if users want to apply optimizations after these they should
   explicitly invoke the optimizations.
 - <csr-id-5d5209b4a5556618d8a8c8219e1e2a4e837256ef/> add an explicit API for creating tick contexts
   Previously, each location had a (semantic) global clock that drives
   ticks, and so all streams in a tick domain were all in the same atomic
   block. For future optimizations, we'd like developers to be able to
   place streams on the same location into different clocks to eliminate
   synchronization between them, which in turn would allow the computations
   in those separate clocks to be potentially decoupled across machines.
 - <csr-id-edd86496240e4ebb39e0cf3bc153d8f282ff2870/> strongly-typed runtime cluster IDs
   Instead of `u32`s everywhere, we now have a `ClusterId<C>` type that
   ensures that cluster IDs are not misused.
 - <csr-id-4f3b51b4b9187f1187be23e6f04034778fe76388/> provide an API for creating cycles across tick iterations
   Towards making it more clear which parts of a program depend on ticks
   versus don't.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0bd3a2d2230cbef24210f71a3ea83d82d1cc7244/> eliminate remaining `Hf` name prefixes
 - <csr-id-9107841700db0ae72de6269ab6f132be0ae51cd9/> location type parameter before boundedness
   When looking at a prefix in an IDE, the location type argument is
   generally more useful.
 - <csr-id-919099ea3a414560b473ec89b993eeb26dfa2579/> dedup signatures for `Singleton` and `Optional`
   Also renames `cross_singleton` to `zip` when both sides are
   singleton-like.
 - <csr-id-5657563c989566e7c7b69dcb395e40b024c83c6c/> fold `Tick` vs `NoTick` into the location type parameter
   Now, when the location is a top-level `Process` or `Cluster` that
   corresponds to a `NoTick`, and for streams inside a tick we wrap the
   location type (e.g. `Tick<Process<...>>`). This simplifies type
   signatures for a lot of our example code.
 - <csr-id-e5b456bdafcb80aae6039e4c90a2e60098e499bf/> simplify intervals and split Paxos-KV into separate module
 - <csr-id-30c4f708faff7875ab42e551dd4bccbe231dfdad/> move input APIs back to being on locations
 - <csr-id-8ad997b2dfd23bb09f7d361d763d6b5e78f406d6/> move `self_id` and `members` to be APIs on cluster instead of builder

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-44c6b149bea102e8598460ba0286e370b36fd25a/> separate singletons into their own types
 - <csr-id-536e6442d68b0947da5bfef9991825003e6867fc/> refactor API to have no-tick semantics by default
   Now, by default streams exist at a "top-level" where there are no ticks
   and operators run over the entire collection. To perform iterative
   computations, developers must explicitly entire a tick domain (using
   `tick_batch`), and return to the outer domain (using `all_ticks`).

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0a465e55dd39c76bc1aefb020460a639d792fe87/> rename integration crates to drop CLI references
 - <csr-id-5f2789a13d1602f170e678fe9bbc59caf69db4b5/> disentangle instantiated nodes from locations
 - <csr-id-128aaecd40edce57dc254afdcd61ecd5b9948d71/> simplify process/cluster specs

   This reverts commit 997d90a76db9a4e05dbac35073a09548750ce342.
   
   We have been trying to figure out the semantics a bit, and want to give
   it more thought before we commit to maintaining it
   
   Can un-revert and adjust the semantics later when we use it

 - <csr-id-e5bdd12e32d6ea72fd91a55c12e09f07a0edaa5c/> add initial test using Hydro CLI from Hydroflow+
   This also required a change to Hydroflow core to make it possible to run the dataflow itself on a single thread (using a LocalSet), even if the surrounding runtime is not single-threaded (required to work around deadlocks because we can't use async APIs inside Hydroflow+). This requires us to spawn any Hydroflow tasks (only for `dest_sink` at the moment) right next to when we run the dataflow rather than when the Hydroflow graph is initialized. From a conceptual perspective, this seems _more right_, since now creating a Hydroflow program will not result in any actual tasks running.
   
   In the third PR of this series, I aim to add a new Hydroflow+ operator that will automate the setup of a `dest_sink`/`source_stream` pair that span nodes.
 - <csr-id-05fb1353cf3e0e8c5da9522365150bd78bd3c5f8/> allow Hydroflow+ programs to emit multiple graphs
   This PR adds support for tagging elements of Hydroflow+ graphs with a node ID, an integer which specifies which Hydroflow graph the computation should be emitted to. The generated code includes the Hydroflow graph for each node ID, so that the appropriate graph can be selected at runtime.
   
   At a larger scale, this is a precursor to adding network operators to Hydroflow+, which will allow distributed logic to be described in a single Hydroflow+ program by specifying points at which data is transferred between different graphs.
