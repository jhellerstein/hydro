Hydro is a high-level distributed programming framework for Rust. Hydro can help you quickly write scalable distributed services that are correct by construction. Much like Rust helps with memory safety, Hydro helps with [**distributed safety**](https://hydro.run/docs/hydro/correctness).

Hydro integrates naturally with standard Rust constructs and IDEs, providing types and programming constructs for ensuring distributed safety. Under the covers, Hydro is powered by the Dataflow Intermediate Representation (DFIR), a compiler and low-level runtime for stream processing. DFIR enables automatic vectorization and efficient scheduling without restricting your application logic.
