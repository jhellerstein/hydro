## v0.13.0 (2025-04-11)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-5ac247ca2006bbb45c5511c78dc6d9028f7451da/> update Stageleft and reduce reliance on DFIR re-exports
 - <csr-id-e0c4abb02054fc3d5dc866286b18f3f2bcd2ad36/> update Stageleft to reduce viral dependencies
   Now that Stageleft handles quoted snippets that refer to local
   dependencies, we do not need to duplicate deps into downstream crates.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dfb7a1b5ad47f03822e9b7cae7dae81914b305e2/> don't pull in dfir_rs during the compilation stage
   Because `hydro_lang` is responsible for _generating_ DFIR code, it
   doesn't actually need to depend on the runtime (`dfir_rs`), other than
   when it is used in the (legacy) macro mode or when we want to include
   utilities for runtime logic (`resource_measurement`). This sticks those
   pieces under feature flags and makes `dfir_rs` an optional dependency,
   which reduces the compile tree for crates like `hydro_test`.

## v0.12.1 (2025-03-15)

<csr-id-38e6721be69f6a41aa47a01a9d06d56a01be1355/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-38e6721be69f6a41aa47a01a9d06d56a01be1355/> remove stageleft from repo, fix #1764
   They grow up so fast 🥹

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-b235a42a3071e55da7b09bdc8bc710b18e0fe053/> demote python deploy docs, fix docsrs configs, fix #1392, fix #1629
   Running thru the quickstart in order to write more about Rust
   `hydro_deploy`, ran into some confusion due to feature-gated items not
   showing up in docs.
   
   `rustdocflags = [ '--cfg=docsrs', '--cfg=stageleft_runtime' ]` uses the
   standard `[cfg(docrs)]` as well as enabled our
   `[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` so things `impl<H: Host + 'static>
   IntoProcessSpec<'_, HydroDeploy> for Arc<H>` show up.
   
   Also set `--all-features` for the docsrs build

### New Features

### Chore

 - <csr-id-49a387d4a21f0763df8ec94de73fb953c9cd333a/> upgrade to Rust 2024 edition

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-75eb323a612fd5d2609e464fe7690bc2b6a8457a/> use correct `__staged` path when rewriting `crate::` imports
   Previously, a rewrite would first turn `crate` into `crate::__staged`,
   and another would rewrite `crate::__staged` into `hydro_test::__staged`.
   The latter global rewrite is unnecessary because the stageleft logic
   already will use the full crate name when handling public types, so we
   drop it.

   Simplifies the logic for generating the public clone of the code, which
   eliminates the need to sprinkle `#[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` (renamed
   from `#[stageleft::runtime]`) everywhere. Also adds logic to pass
   through `cfg` attrs when re-exporting public types.
